# Girco: A simple IRC client written in Go!

Work in progress. Built for myself to learn Go, the IRC protocol, and to kill time during quarantine season.

## Usage
As per the IRC protocol, choose a Nick (nickname), connection password, and User.

Then call as
`go run main.go <NICK> <PASS> <USER>`

## Goals
- Basic IRC client functionality (Chat, join networks and channels)
- Multiple opened network / channels
- TLS / SSL support
